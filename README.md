## Screens

- Home screen with a list of anti-apps.

## Features

Conceptual:

- **AntiCalculator** composes an equation where the entered number is the root.

- **AntiFlashlight** shines screen in black.

- **AntiWeather** shows the weather in units you don't want to see it in. Uses [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org).

- **AntiCamera** deletes the last photo when taking a picture.

- **AntiCalendar** shows in what years and months there was such a number with such a day of the week.

- **AntiNotes** allows you to create notes, but then shows other users' notes.

- **AntiText** inverts the entered text.

Useful for grading:

- `flutter_lints` is used.
